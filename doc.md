Below is a comprehensive Admin Guide for deploying and managing the SharePoint 2016 On-Prem Survey Dashboard, followed by a PDF Report section (formatted as Markdown for easy conversion to PDF using tools like Pandoc or online converters like markdown-to-pdf.com).
For the PDF Report, copy the Markdown content into a tool like Pandoc (pandoc report.md -o report.pdf) or an online converter to generate a downloadable PDF. I've included a printable layout with headers, tables, and sections.
